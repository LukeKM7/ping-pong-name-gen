# ping-pong-name-gen

Trivial experiment with VueJS. 

Name generator for lunchtime Ping Pong.

## Usage

It is assumed that you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org) installed.

To run locally:

1. Clone down the repository.

2. Navigate to the project folder and run:
`npm run serve` 

3. This will trigger the development server to start and the app will be accessible on localhost port 8080.

## TODO
* Connect the VueJS frontend to a database backend technology, so that we can store the random words, just for proof of concept.
* Dockerize the app, for portability.
